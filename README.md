# REACT MEME GENERATOR

- This code is using Axios to fetch data from `memegen.link` and allows the user to create their own memes.
- The user has two input fields `top text` and `bottom text`, which will be added to the selected meme.
- There's only a list of my favorite memes, but those can be extended by updating the code on line `92`.
- After pressing the `Download` button, the meme will be downloaded locally.
